<h1 class="fancy_title">About Us</h1><br> 

		

<p>Sam's Barbershop is the result of a vision to recreate the barbershop from past generations. The clean-cut look and styles from the 50’s and 60’s were more than just a simple haircut – it was an experience.</p><br>

<p>Today’s modern salons and chain barbershops use only clippers, leaving the service of straight edge razor shaves a thing of the past. Today, many barbers lack traditional art forms such as, beard trimming using a straight edge razor, hot lather neck shaves, complimentary beverage, or even just enjoying "small talk" - we have created a sanctuary for men and a place where they can go to experience the old-school barbershop.</p><br> 

<p>Sam's Barbershop is a traditional barbershop with a modern twist. In addition to having 11 years of experience, we continually stay “in the know” of the latest in men's styles, combined with using our skills, to offer some of today's hottest styles. It's all about making our clients feel invigorated and refreshed, while catering to your needs.</p><br> 

<p>Some of the services we offer include brow, ear and nose grooming, shampoo and conditioning, scalp massages, hot lather shaves, and of course, “High End” barbering and grooming services. We deliver an unforgettable experience, delivered to you by extraordinary barbers.</p><br>
